The grid class in the grid.py create a array coordinates of grid cell center

The multipole class in the multipole.py is used to do the multipole expansion. In the 2-d case, one can just calculate the 
potential with brute force. Here, I simulate the MacLaurin Spheroid with the brute force codes. One can just initiate it with
grid, the class of the array of grid cell center, and n_moments, the largest l value of the expansion, and center, the 
expansion center.

When doing the expansion, one should first creat a multipole class object, m. Then use the m.compute_expansion method with
density distribution as argument. Then use the m.phi() method to get the potential of a single point.

The L2_difference.py contains the L2_diff(analytical_phi, approximate_phi, grid) function, where analytical_phi is the
analytical potential and the approximate_phi is the approximated potential. This function compute the L2 error

comparitive_difference.py contains the class comp_diff, which can be created with apotential, the analytical potential,
and approximated potential. The member comp_diff.difference is the comparative normalized error
